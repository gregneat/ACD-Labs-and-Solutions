Lab Goal: Tell the user whether they got at least one word correct
in the typing game.  Send the message to the command window.
This lab uses both the graphics window and the command window.  
Assume both Strings (answer and typed) are same length.
Also assume the error happens within a word, not a space or
punctuation.
